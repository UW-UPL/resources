## Essentials

There are many lists filled with largely interchangable guides to language syntax, OOP-style code organization, and using existing libraries.
These lists are sufficient to write software, but they are not sufficient to write *good* software.
This list contains things programmers should be aware of, but are unlikely to encounter on their own.

- [Why I find it hard to learn with AI](https://andresc.substack.com/p/why-i-find-it-hard-to-learn-with): How using AI tools such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot can stunt the processes of learning.
- [The Law of Leaky Abstractions](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/): Explains how while abstractions greater levels of productivity, it is still necessary to understand what they are abstracting over.
- [Mike Acton - Data-oriented design and C++ (CppCon 2014)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc): Classic talk explaining how popular software development methodologies result in bad software.
- [Andrew Kelley - Practical DOD](https://vimeo.com/649009599): How to implement some of the insights from Mike Acton's talk.
- [Files are fraught with peril](https://danluu.com/deconstruct-files/): An article that goes into depth about how writing to files works at the system call level, and how the simple act of writing to a file can go wrong.
- [Reading citations is easier than most people think](https://danluu.com/dunning-kruger/): Popular "science-based" memes are often not actually backed by science: perceived skill correlates with actual skill and money buys happiness.
