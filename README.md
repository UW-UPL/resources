# UPL Resources

This repository contains carefully selected resources across multiple domains, focusing on foundational knowledge, practical applications, and hidden gems. Each list is maintained with quality over quantity in mind.

## Lists
- [Essentials](./lists/essentials.md): There are many lists filled with largely interchangable guides to language syntax, OOP-style code organization, and using existing libraries.
These lists are sufficient to write software, but they are not sufficient to write *good* software.
This list contains things programmers should be aware of, but are unlikely to encounter on their own.
- [Unix](./lists/unix.md): Contains a variety of resources on the design, implementation, and historical legacy of Unix-style operating systems. 
- [Software Performance](./lists/performance.md): Gotta go fast.
- [Databases & Filesystems](./lists/databases-and-filesystems.md): Storing and working with data.
- [For Fun](./lists/for-fun.md): Believe it or not, there is fun to be had in computer programming.

### WIP
- [Programming Languages](./lists/programming-languages.md): Design, implementation, and theory of programming languages.
